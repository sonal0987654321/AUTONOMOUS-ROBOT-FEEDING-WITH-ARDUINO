# AUTONOMOUS-ROBOT-FEEDING-WITH-ARDUINO
This mechanical structure is designed to feed a person automatically.This work investigates modelling and control of the Robot manipulator by analyzing the kinematics of the robot and applying control techniques. Thesis work is undertaken in the following developmental stages first we derive the forward and inverse kinematics equation for the robot
